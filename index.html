<h2>About website</h2>
<p>     This website gives you information, awareness, and etc. about smoking. I'm hoping people of all ages can acknoledge how dangerous smoking is, and why you shouldn't begin to.</p>
<h2>About smoking</h2>

<P>     Smoking is the inhalation and exhalation of smoke from burning tobacco in cigars, cigarettes and pipes which has a history starting in the late 1500's. Originally, smoking was as a practice followed by natives of the Western Hemisphere for religious rituals and medicinal purposes.<P>
<p>Today, smoking is very common. In 2011, an estimated 19% of U.S. adults were cigarette smokers. Additionally,
about 18% of high school students smoked cigarettes.</p>

<p>     Over 4,000 chemicals such as nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and many others are present in cigarettes. This also includes 43 known cancer-causing compounds and 400 other toxins. Furthermore, Cigarettes contain nicotine, which is a highly addictive drug.<p>
