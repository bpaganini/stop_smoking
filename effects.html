<h2>Health Effects of Smoking</h2>
    <p>Of course, bringing unnecessary chemicals into your body such as nicotine, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and many others will put you at a high risk for dangerous health effects. These are some of the health effects of smoking:
</p>
<h3>Heart Disease</h3>
    <P>Smoking may start blockages and narrowing in your arteries, which means less blood and oxygen flow to your heart, causing heart disease. When cigarette consumption in the U.S. decreased, the rates of heart disease did as well.
</P>

<h3>Cancer</h3>
    <p>Because there is 43 known cancer-causing compounds in cigarettes, there is a high chance you may develop cancer. Not just lung cancer, but also throat, kidney, liver, pancreas, and stomach cancers. You can even get acute myeloid leukemia from smoking.
</p>

<h3>COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)</h3>
<p>COPD is an obstructive lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. It causes serious prolonged disability and early death. COPD starts by making it hard to be active, and gets worse over time. Simple activities, such as climbing a short set of stairs or walking to get the mail can get exhausting or impossible. Approximately 80% of all COPD cases are caused by cigarette smoking. 
    </p>

<h3>Emphysema</h3>
    <p>Smoking destroys the alveoli (tiny air sacs) in the lungs that allow oxygen exchange. When you smoke, you damage some of those air sacs. Since alveoli doesnâ€™t grow back, if you damage them, you will permanently damage part of your lungs. If a significant amount of alveoli is destroyed, emphysema will develop. Emphysema causes severe shortness of breath and may lead to death.</p>

<h3>Premature aging</h3>
    <p>The chemicals in cigarettes damage collagen and elastin, which are fibers that give  skin strength and elasticity. If collagen and elastin in  skin is damaged, your skin will begin to sag and wrinkles will appear.</p>

<h3>Aortic aneurysm</h3>
    <P>The Aorta is the human body's main artery. Smoking causes aortic aneurysm. Aortic aneurysm is when the aorta widens and begins to leak, which will damage your entire body.</p> 

<h3>Stroke</h3>
    <p>Because smoking affects your arteries, it may cause a stroke. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is becomes blocked impermanetl'''y. As a result, brain cells will become low in oxygen and begin to die. A stroke can cause paralysis, slurred speech, altered brain function and even death.</p>

<h3>Sticky Blood</h3>
    <p>Smoking causes your to blood to become thick and sticky. If blood is sticky, your heart must work harder in order to move it around your body. Also, sticky blood has an increased chance of clotting, which can block blood flow to your heart, brain, and legs.</p>

<h3>Weakened immune system</h3>
    <p>Since cigarette smoke contains a high amount of dangerous chemicals, it can make your immune system less effective at fighting off infections. You may also have an increased change of becoming ill and vulnerability to autoimmune diseases.</p>

<h3>High white blood cell count</h3>
    <p>If you have a high white blood cell count (cells that defend your body from infections), it is most likely a sign that your body is constantly attempting to fight damage in your body. Smoking causes inflammation and damage in your body, therefore giving your body a high amount of white blood cells.</p>
